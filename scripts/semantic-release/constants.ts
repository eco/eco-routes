 * @file constants.ts
 *
 * Central configuration for all semantic-release scripts and deployment processes.
 *
 * This file serves as the single source of truth for paths, environment variable names,
 * and other constants used throughout the release process. By centralizing these values,
 * we ensure consistency across different scripts and make maintenance simpler.
 *
 * The constants include:
 * - File paths for build artifacts and deployment results
 * - Environment variable names for configuration
 * - Required environment variables for different operations
 * - Package naming conventions
 * - Performance thresholds and limits
 *
 * These constants are used by the deployment, verification, and packaging scripts
 * to locate files, validate configurations, and ensure consistent behavior.
