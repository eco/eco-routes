## IntentSource

The IntentSource is where intent publishing and reward claiming functionality live. Users (or actors on their behalf) can publish intents here, as well as fund intents' rewards. After an intent is fulfilled and proven, a solver can fetch their rewards here as well. This contract is not expected to hold any funds between transactions.

## Inbox (Inbox.sol)

The Inbox is where intent fulfillment lives. Solvers fulfill intents on the Inbox via one of the contract's fulfill methods, which pulls in solver resources and executes the intent's calls on the destination chain. Once an intent has been fulfilled, any subsequent attempts to fulfill it will be reverted. The Inbox also contains some post-fulfillment proving-related logic.

### Methods

<h4><ins>fulfillStorage</ins></h4>
<h5> Allows a filler to fulfill an intent on its destination chain to be proven by the StorageProver specified in the intent. The filler also gets to predetermine the address on the destination chain that will receive the reward tokens.</h5>

Parameters:

- `_sourceChainID` (uint256) the ID of the chain where the fulfilled intent originated
- `_targets` (address[]) the address on the destination chain at which the instruction sets need to be executed
- `_data` (bytes[]) the instructions to be executed on \_targets
- `_expiryTime` (uint256) the timestamp at which the intent expires
- `_nonce` (bytes32) the nonce of the calldata. Composed of the hash on the source chain of the global nonce and chainID
- `_claimant` (address) the address that can claim the fulfilled intent's fee on the source chain
- `_expectedHash` (bytes32) the hash of the intent. Used to verify that the correct data is being input

<ins>Security:</ins> This method can be called by anyone, but cannot be called again for the same intent, thus preventing a double fulfillment. This method executes arbitrary calls written by the intent creator on behalf of the Inbox contract - it is important that the caller be aware of what they are executing. The Inbox will be the msg.sender for these calls. \_sourceChainID, the destination's chainID, the inbox address, \_targets, \_data, \_expiryTime, and \_nonce are hashed together to form the intent's hash on the IntentSource - any incorrect inputs will result in a hash that differs from the original, and will prevent the intent's reward from being withdrawn (as this means the intent fulfilled differed from the one created). The \_expectedHash input exists only to help prevent this before fulfillment.

<h4><ins>fulfillHyperInstant</ins></h4>
<h5> Allows a filler to fulfill an intent on its destination chain to be proven by the HyperProver specified in the intent. After fulfilling the intent, this method packs the intentHash and claimant into a message and sends it over the Hyperlane bridge to the HyperProver on the source chain. The filler also gets to predetermine the address on the destination chain that will receive the reward tokens.</h5>

Parameters:

- `_sourceChainID` (uint256) the ID of the chain where the fulfilled intent originated
- `_targets` (address[]) the address on the destination chain at which the instruction sets need to be executed
- `_data` (bytes[]) the instructions to be executed on \_targets
- `_expiryTime` (uint256) the timestamp at which the intent expires
- `_nonce` (bytes32) the nonce of the calldata. Composed of the hash on the source chain of the global nonce and chainID
- `_claimant` (address) the address that can claim the fulfilled intent's fee on the source chain
- `_expectedHash` (bytes32) the hash of the intent. Used to verify that the correct data is being input
- `_prover` (address) the address of the hyperProver on the source chain

<ins>Security:</ins> This method inherits all of the security features in fulfillstorage. This method is also payable, as funds are required to use the hyperlane bridge.

<h4><ins>fulfillHyperInstantWithRelayer</ins></h4>
<h5> Performs the same functionality as fulfillHyperInstant, but allows the user to use a custom HyperLane relayer and pass in the corresponding metadata</h5>

Parameters:

- `_sourceChainID` (uint256) the ID of the chain where the fulfilled intent originated

- `_metadata` (bytes) Metadata for postDispatchHook (empty bytes if not applicable)
- `_postDispatchHook` (address) Address of postDispatchHook (zero address if not applicable)

<ins>Security:</ins> This method inherits all of the security features in fulfillstorage. This method is also payable, as funds are required to use the hyperlane bridge. Additionally, the user is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the passed in metadata and relayer perform according to their expectations

<h4><ins>fulfillHyperBatched</ins></h4>`
<h5> Allows a filler to fulfill an intent on its destination chain to be proven by the HyperProver specified in the intent. After fulfilling the intent, this method emits an event that indicates which intent was fulfilled. Fillers of hyperprover-destined intents will listen to these events and batch process them later on. The filler also gets to predetermine the address on the destination chain that will receive the reward tokens. Note: this method is currently not supported by Eco's solver services, but has been included for completeness. Work on services for this method is ongoing.</h5>

Parameters:

- `_sourceChainID` (uint256) the ID of the chain where the fulfilled intent originated
- `_targets` (address[]) the address on the destination chain at which the instruction sets need to be executed
- `_data` (bytes[]) the instructions to be executed on \_targets
- `_expiryTime` (uint256) the timestamp at which the intent expires
- `_nonce` (bytes32) the nonce of the calldata. Composed of the hash on the source chain of the global nonce and chainID
- `_claimant` (address) the address that can claim the fulfilled intent's fee on the source chain

<ins>Security:</ins> This method inherits all of the security features in fulfillstorage.

<h4><ins>sendBatch</ins></h4>

<h5> Allows a filler to send a batch of HyperProver-destined intents over the HyperLane bridge. This reduces the cost per intent proven, as intents that would have had to be sent in separate messages are now consolidated into one. </h5>

Parameters:

- `_sourceChainID` (uint256) the chainID of the source chain
- `_prover` (address) the address of the hyperprover on the source chain
- `_intentHashes` (bytes32[]) the hashes of the intents to be proven

<ins>Security:</ins> This method ensures that all passed-in hashes correspond to intents that have been fulfilled according to the inbox. It contains a low-level call to send native tokens, but will only do this in the event that the call to this method has a nonzero msg.value. The method is payable because the HyperLane relayer requires fees in native token in order to function.

<h4><ins>sendBatchWithRelayer</ins></h4>

<h5> Performs the same functionality as sendBatch, but allows the user to use a custom HyperLane relayer and pass in the corresponding metadata. </h5>

Parameters:

- `_sourceChainID` (uint256) the chainID of the source chain
- `_prover` (address) the address of the hyperprover on the source chain
- `_intentHashes` (bytes32[]) the hashes of the intents to be proven
- `_metadata` (bytes) Metadata for postDispatchHook (empty bytes if not applicable)
- `_postDispatchHook` (address) Address of postDispatchHook (zero address if not applicable)

<ins>Security:</ins> This method inherits all of the security features in sendBatch. Additionally, the user is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the passed in metadata and relayer perform according to their expectations.

<h4><ins>fetchFee</ins></h4>

<h5> A passthrough method that calls the HyperLane Mailbox and fetches the cost of sending a given message. This method is used inside both the fulfillHyperInstant and sendBatch methods to ensure that the user has enough gas to send the message over HyperLane's bridge.</h5>

Parameters:

- `_sourceChainID` (uint256) the chainID of the source chain
- `_messageBody` (bytes) the message body being sent over the bridge
- `_prover` (address) the address of the hyperprover on the source chain

<ins>Security:</ins> This method inherits all of the security features in fulfillstorage. This method is also payable, as funds are required to use the hyperlane bridge.

<h4><ins>makeSolvingPublic</ins></h4>

<h5>Opens up solving functionality to all addresses if it is currently restricted to a whitelist.</h5>

<ins>Security:</ins> This method can only be called by the owner of the Inbox, and can only be called if solving is not currently public. There is no function to re-restrict solving - once it is public it cannot become private again.

<h5>Changes the solving permissions for a given address.</h5>

Parameters:

- `_solver` (address) the address of the solver whose permissions are being changed
- `_canSolve`(bool) whether or not \_solver will be able to solve after this method is called

Parameters:

- `_destination` (address) the destination of the transferred funds

<ins>Security:</ins> This method can only be called by the owner of the Inbox. This method is primarily for testing purposes.

## HyperProver (HyperProver.sol)

A message-based implementation of BaseProver that consumes data coming from HyperLane's message bridge sent by the Inbox on the destination chain. intentHash - claimant address pairs sent across the chain are written to the HyperProver's provenIntents mapping and are later read by the IntentSource when reward withdrawals are attempted.

### Events

<h4><ins>IntentProven</ins></h4>
<h5> emitted when an intent has been successfully proven</h5>

Parameters:

- `_hash` (bytes32) the hash of the intent
- `_claimant` (address) the address that can claim this intent's rewards

<h4><ins>IntentAlreadyProven</ins></h4>
<h5> emitted when an attempt is made to re-prove an already-proven intent</h5>

Parameters:

- `_hash` (bytes32) the hash of the intent

### Methods

<h4><ins>handle</ins></h4>
<h5>Called by the HyperLane Mailbox contract to finish the HyperProving process. This method parses the message sent via HyperLane into intent hashes and their corresponding claimant addresses, then writes them to the provenIntents mapping so that the IntentSource can read from them when a reward withdrawal is attempted.</h5>

Parameters:

- ` ` (uint32) this variable is not used, but is required by the interface. it is the chain ID of the intent's origin chain.
- `_sender` (bytes32) the address that called dispatch() on the HyperLane Mailbox on the destination chain
- `_messageBody` (bytes) the message body containing intent hashes and their corresponding claimants

<ins>Security:</ins> This method is public but there are checks in place to ensure that it reverts unless msg.sender is the local hyperlane mailbox and \_sender is the destination chain's inbox. This method has direct write access to the provenIntents mapping and, therefore, gates access to the rewards for hyperproven intents.

## Storage Prover (Prover.sol)

A storage-based implementation of BaseProver that utilizes the digests posted between rollups and mainnet to verify fulfilled status of intents on the destination chain.

### Events

<h4><ins>L1WorldStateProven</ins></h4>
<h5> emitted when L1 world state is proven</h5>

Parameters:

- `_blocknumber` (uint256) the block number corresponding to this L1 world state
- `_L1WorldStateRoot` (bytes32) the world state root at \_blockNumber

<h4><ins>L2WorldStateProven</ins></h4>
<h5> emitted when L2 world state is proven</h5>

Parameters:

- `_destinationChainID` (uint256) the chainID of the destination chain
- `_blocknumber` (uint256) the block number corresponding to this L2 world state
- `_L2WorldStateRoot` (bytes32) the world state root at \_blockNumber

<h4><ins>IntentProven</ins></h4>
<h5> emitted when an intent has been successfully proven</h5>

Parameters:

- `_hash` (bytes32) the hash of the intent
- `_claimant` (address) the address that can claim this intent's rewards

### Methods

<h4><ins>proveSettlementLayerState</ins></h4>
<h5> validates input L1 block state against the L1 oracle contract. This method does not need to be called per intent, but the L2 batch containing the intent must have been settled to L1 on or before this block.</h5>

Parameters:

- `rlpEncodedBlockData` (bytes) properly encoded L1 block data

<ins>Security:</ins> This method can be called by anyone. Inputting the correct block's data encoded as expected will result in its hash matching the blockhash found on the L1 oracle contract. This means that the world state root found in that block corresponds to the block on the oracle contract, and that it represents a valid state. Notably, only one block's data is present on the oracle contract at a time, so the input data must match that block specifically, or the method will revert.

<h4><ins>proveWorldStateBedrock</ins></h4>
<h5> Validates World state by ensuring that the passed in world state root corresponds to value in the L2 output oracle on the Settlement Layer.  We submit a `StorageProof` proving that the L2 Block is included in a batch that has been settled to L1 and an `AccountProof` proving that the `StorageProof` submitted is linked to a `WorldState` for the contract that the `StorageProof` is for.</h5>

For Optimisms BedRock release we submit an `outputRoot` storage proof created by concatenating

```solidity
output_root = kecakk256( version_byte || state_root || withdrawal_storage_root || latest_block_hash)
```

## Cross-Chain Message Bridge Architecture

Eco Protocol has been refactored to use a modular message bridge architecture for cross-chain communication. This allows the protocol to leverage different messaging systems like Hyperlane and Metalayer while maintaining a consistent interface.

### Message Bridge Provers

The protocol now follows a flexible architecture with a hierarchy of prover implementations:

1. **BaseProver**: Abstract base contract that defines core proving functionality
2. **MessageBridgeProver**: Abstract contract that extends BaseProver with common functionality for message-based proving
3. **Concrete Provers**: Specific implementations for different messaging systems:
   - **HyperProver**: Uses Hyperlane for cross-chain messaging
   - **MetaProver**: Uses Caldera Metalayer for cross-chain messaging

### Security Features

All message bridge provers implement these security features:

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against reentrancy attacks during token transfers
- **Array Length Validation**: Ensures message data integrity with array length checks
- **Message Sender Validation**: Prevents unauthorized message handling
- **Payment Processing**: Secure handling of native token payments for bridge fees
- **Prover Whitelisting**: Only authorized addresses can initiate proving

### Integration Patterns

To use a message bridge prover with the Eco Protocol:

1. **Deploy the Prover**: Deploy the specific prover (HyperProver or MetaProver) with configuration for your chosen message bridge
2. **Register with Inbox**: Add the prover to the Inbox's approved provers list
3. **Create Intents**: Create intents specifying the prover to use for cross-chain proof transmission
4. **Solve Intents**: When solving intents, specify the appropriate proof type in the fulfillment call

### Supported Message Bridges

#### Hyperlane

The HyperProver uses Hyperlane's IMessageRecipient interface to receive and process cross-chain messages. It interacts with the Hyperlane Mailbox contract to send and receive messages.

Configuration parameters:

- Mailbox address: Address of the Hyperlane Mailbox on the current chain
- Trusted provers: List of addresses authorized to send proof messages

#### Metalayer

The MetaProver uses Caldera Metalayer's IMetalayerRecipient interface to receive and process cross-chain messages. It interacts with the Metalayer Router contract to send and receive messages.

Configuration parameters:

- Router address: Address of the Metalayer Router on the current chain
- Trusted provers: List of addresses authorized to send proof messages

### ERC-7683 Support

The previous standalone ERC-7683 implementation has been refactored into the core protocol. Instead of separate settler contracts, ERC-7683 compatibility is now integrated within the Inbox contract using the message bridge provers for cross-chain communication.

This refactoring offers several benefits:

- More consistent codebase with less duplication
- Better security through shared validation logic
- More flexible proving mechanisms
- Easier integration of new cross-chain messaging solutions
