## About The Project

This is the ECO intent Protocol Backend

### Built With

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Running this project locally requires the following:

- [NodeJS v18.20.3](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.20.3) - using nvm (instructions below)
- [Yarn v1.22.19](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn/v/1.22.19)

It is recommended to use `nvm` to install Node. This is a Node version manager so your computer can easily handle multiple versions of Node:

1. Install `nvm` using the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
```

2. If you're not on an M1 Mac, skip to step 3. For Node < v15, `nvm` will need to be run in a Rosetta terminal since those versions are not supported by the M1 chip for installation. To do that, in the terminal simply run either:

If running bash:

```sh
arch -x86_64 bash
```

If running zsh:

```sh
arch -x86_64 zsh
```

More information about this can be found in [this thread](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/2350).

3. Install our Node version using the following command:

```sh
nvm install v18.20.3
```

4. Once the installation is complete you can use it by running:

```bash
nvm use v18.20.3
```

You should see it as the active Node version by running:

```bash
nvm ls
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```bash
 git clone git@github.com:eco/ecoism.git
```

2. Install and build ecoism using yarn

```bash
 yarn install
```

```bash
 yarn build
```

## Lint

```bash
yarn lint
```

## Test

```bash
# tests
$ yarn  test

# test coverage
$ yarn coverage
```

## Testnet End to End Tests

For more information please see [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)

### Deployment

Before beginning end to end tests on sepolia you must deploy the following contracts

```bash

# Deploy IntentSource and Prover contracts on Source Chain
yarn deploySourceAndProver

# Deploy Inbox contract on Destination chain
yarn deployInbox

```

### End to End Testing

There is a script which does End Testing

```bash
yarn intentWalkthrough

```
