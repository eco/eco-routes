/**
 * @file sr-prepare.ts
 *
 * Orchestrates the preparation phase of semantic releases for smart contract projects.
 * This critical step runs after version determination but before package publication,
 * handling the building, deployment, and verification of contracts across all networks.
 *
 * The prepare phase is responsible for:
 * 1. Ensuring all build dependencies are installed
 * 2. Compiling and optimizing smart contracts with Foundry
 * 3. Deploying contracts with deterministic addresses across multiple chains
 * 4. Verifying deployed contract source code on block explorers
 * 5. Generating deployment artifacts for client libraries
 * 6. Building the TypeScript package with correct version information
 *
 * This script coordinates with other semantic release plugins to ensure
 * consistent versioning across the entire release pipeline, processing both
 * mainnet and pre-production environments with appropriate salt derivation
 * to guarantee deterministic cross-chain addresses.
 *
 * The prepare step is crucial as it creates the deploymentAddresses.json file
 * that gets bundled with the published package, enabling clients to interact
 * with the deployed contracts without hardcoding addresses.
