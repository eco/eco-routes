/**
 * @file sr-publish.ts
 *
 * Manages the final publishing step in the semantic-release process, handling the
 * distribution of built packages to npm and other registries. This is the culmination
 * of the entire release pipeline, making the new version publicly available.
 *
 * This module implements strict publishing controls and verification to ensure
 * only properly built, tested, and authorized packages are published to registries.
 * It includes safety mechanisms to prevent accidental publishing from development
 * environments and handles proper version tagging.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Environment-aware publishing decisions (CI vs. local development)
 * - Comprehensive dry-run support for testing the release process
 * - Intelligent tag selection (latest, next, beta) based on version type
 * - Package integrity verification before publishing
 * - Registry authentication and publishing authorization
 * - Detailed logging and feedback on publish status
 * - Publication metadata generation for semantic-release tracking
 *
 * The publish step integrates with CI/CD pipelines and handles environment-specific
 * authentication, ensuring secure credential management during the publishing process.

/**
 * Publishes both packages to npm: the main package with Solidity files and the TypeScript-only package.

 * both the main eco-routes package (containing Solidity files) and the TypeScript-only
 * package for clients that don't need the Solidity source.
 *
 * The publishing process includes:
 * 1. Determining appropriate npm tag based on version type (latest, beta, etc.)
 * 2. Configuring package.json for each package type before publishing
 * 3. Verifying the package build is complete and correct
 * 4. Publishing packages with proper authentication
 * 5. Handling dry-run mode for testing the publishing process
 *

 * @param context - The semantic release context with version and logging information
 * @returns Object containing published package names and their registry URLs
 *
 * @throws Will throw an error if publishing fails for any reason
