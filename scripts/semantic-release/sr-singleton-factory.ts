/**
 * @file sr-singleton-factory.ts
 *
 * Handles the deployment of the canonical EIP-2470 Singleton Factory contract.
 * This module is a critical prerequisite for deterministic contract deployment
 * across multiple EVM chains during the semantic release process.
 *
 * The Singleton Factory is a standard contract deployed to the same address
 * (0xce0042B868300000d44A59004Da54A005ffdcf9f) on all EVM chains using a
 * specific private key and nonce. It provides a CREATE2 mechanism that enables
 * the deterministic deployment of contracts with consistent addresses across
 * all chains that support the EVM.
 *
 * This implementation:
 * - Verifies if the factory is already deployed on each target chain
 * - Deploys the factory using the canonical deployment process if not present
 * - Handles the specific gas parameters needed for different networks
 * - Ensures the factory is available for subsequent contract deployments
 * - Integrates with the semantic-release workflow to prevent deployment failures
 *
 * The presence of this factory is essential for the cross-chain consistency
 * that the eco-routes protocol relies on for its operation.
