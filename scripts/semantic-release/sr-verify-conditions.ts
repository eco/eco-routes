/**

 *
 * Ensures all prerequisites are met before beginning the semantic release process.
 * As the first step in the release pipeline, this verification acts as a gatekeeper
 * to prevent attempted releases that would fail later in the process.
 *
 * This module implements comprehensive validation of the environment, credentials,
 * package configuration, and deployment requirements before proceeding with any
 * further release steps. It provides early detection of potential issues and
 * clear, actionable error messages when requirements aren't met.
 *
 * Comprehensive verification checks include:
 * - Required environment variables and deployment credentials
 * - Package.json structure, completeness, and validity
 * - Smart contract compilation readiness
 * - npm registry authentication and publishing permissions
 * - Git repository status and access rights
 * - Version compatibility with existing releases
 * - Deployment key and verification key availability
 *
 * By validating all requirements upfront, this step prevents issues that would
 * otherwise be discovered later in the release process, after significant time
 * and resources have been invested.

/**
 * Verifies all required conditions are met before a release can proceed.
 *
 * This function implements the first step in the semantic-release lifecycle,
 * acting as a gatekeeper to prevent releases that would fail later in the process.
 * It performs comprehensive validation of the environment, credentials, and
 * package configuration before allowing the release to continue.
 *
 * The verification process includes:
 * 1. Checking that all required environment variables are set for deployments and publishing
 * 2. Validating the package.json exists and contains all necessary fields
 * 3. Verifying the next version is valid according to semver and greater than what's published
 * 4. Ensuring npm publishing credentials are available in the environment
 * 5. Validating that release conditions are appropriate for the current context
 *
 * @param pluginConfig - Plugin configuration options from semantic-release
 * @param context - Semantic release context with version, logger and environment info
 * @returns Promise that resolves when all conditions are verified successfully
 * @throws Error with detailed message if any verification check fails
 *
 * @example
 * // This function is called by semantic-release automatically
 * // Usage in semantic-release configuration:
 * module.exports = {
 *   verifyConditions
 * }
